# Simple-Frame-Extractor
Simple Frame Extractor<br><br>

OpenCV Version:2.4.11<br><br>

This code could be used for extracting certain frames inside a video. When you use it, you should change the directory of the `.mp4` file as well as the number of frames you plan to skip. <br>

Feel free to ask me at `albuspeter.rzh@gmail.com`, if you have any question.
